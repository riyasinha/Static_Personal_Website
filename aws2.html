	My life has been kind of a nomadic one. I had changed nine institutes during my school days. Don't worry, I wasn't kicked out of them, it's just that my father has had a nomadic life too and many a times I changed them in the same city for better education. I think my longest strike in a school was for three and a half years. <br>
	So, I have lived at a lot of places in my short life. I was born in Vadodara, Gujarat and have spent a lot of time at Ahmedabad. Being my grandparents' home, I have visited it at least once every year. But the years that have shaped a major part of me have been spent in Doha, Qatar. I have spent almost six years in the country and will still go back during my vacations. <br>
	Moving on to my interests, I happen to be a foodie. Food is my one true love. I love a lot of the different cuisines in the world and world brings me to my other passion-Travel. I don't want to travel the world as a tourist, rather, as a traveller. I want to experience different cultures and traditions of different countries of the world and enjoy them all. I also like sports and tennis is my favourite one. Another dream of mine would be to watch Wimbledon from the lower box. And last but not the least, I love to read and write. Books are my soulmates and best friends.
