	I do like writing a lot but, at the same time, being the lazy person I am, I happen to be quite reluctant about it. In the first semester of my college I took a course in which we were expected to write blogs as an assignment. I started writing and most of the times got so engrossed such that I actually put a piece of myself in my writings; be it my beliefs, my thoughts, my emotions - anything and everything. So, should you feel like getting into my mind a little more and reading about my views on different things, go to my blog site <a href="https://riyasinhaweb.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> <font color="white" size="5">THE RELCUTANT BLOGGER</a>
